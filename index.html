  <h2 style="color:red">This Historic Season</h2>
    <p style="color:white"> This season the Georgia Bulldawgs football team pulled off one of their best seasons in years. We won the SEC Championship for the first time in twelve years, and Georgia was the winner of the highest scoring Rose Bowl in the history of NCAA football. Before the season began, most Georgia fans were expecting another painfully mediocre year with a couple extremely disappointing loses, but that all changed the moment Jacob Eason injured his knee in the Appalachian State game. Kirby was forced to play his freshman back up quarter back, Jake Fromm. From there, Fromm’s brilliant play as a freshman quarterback, the two best running backs in the nation, Nick Chubb and Sony Michel, and one of the best defenses in the country led by Roquan Smith paved the way for Georgia’s best season in more than a decade.

  <h2 style="color:red">The 2017-2018 Playoffs</h2>
<p style="color:white">Georgia’s playoff run began on December 2nd, 2017 with the Bulldawgs playing the Auburn Tigers for the SEC Championship in the new Mercedes Benz Stadium in Atlanta, Georgia. Earlier this season UGA had a devastating loss to Auburn which ended their undefeated season, and most expected that Auburn would beat Georgia again. Though out the first half, the dawgs were losing, but UGA showed out in the second half and won the game. Georgia’s epic playoff season continued on January 1st, 2018 into the highest scoring Rose Bowl ever playing against Baker Mayfield and Oklahoma Sooners. Georgia won the game in overtime after the bulldawg defense blocked a field goal, and Sony Michel ran in a 27-yard touchdown. However, this playoff run was ended on January 8th, 2018 against the despicable Alabama Crimson Tide. Georgia looked as if they were going to win their first National Championship in 37 years, but Nick Saban crushed their dreams with a back pocket freshman quarterback that stole the game in the second half. It was devastating defeat for the Bulldawgs. However, this season is surrounded in bright hopes for the future under Kirby Smart and Jake Fromm.

  <h2 style="color:white">UGA Football History</h2>
  <p style="color:red">
  The University of Georgia has one of the oldest football programs in the nation, beginning in 1892. The Football program is a part the Eastern Division of the Southeastern Conference (SEC East) and has won the SEC Championship 13 times which is tied for the second most of all time. Also, the dawgs have appeared in 54 bowl games and won the National Championship twice. However, Georgia has not won the National Championship in almost 40 years now. Although the dawgs have been in a drought of championships in recent history, the program has over 800 wins placing them at the 11th most winningest team in college football. Georgia’s oldest rival, Auburn, dates back to the inaugural season, and the dawgs have stayed on top of the rivalry with 58 wins against Auburn and only 56 losses.
